## Query Service Background

The Query Service enable client applications to get Process & Task data without going
straight to the Runtime Bundles. The Query Service was designed to enable efficient
querying mechanisms for data generated by one or more Runtime Bundles. In contrast with
the Audit Service, the Query Service picks up the event and apply some transformations to
store state.
This component was designed to aggregate data from a set of related Runtime Bundles,
allowing consumers to filter using the runtime bundle.
